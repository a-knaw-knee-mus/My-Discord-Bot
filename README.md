# My-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot I made using Python 3 and Replit to host it 24/7
- All the functions of the bot can be learned through the '$help' command
- The '$chess' command retrieves data from the desired user on chess.com for one of 3 gamemodes (rapid, blitz, bullet). There is also error-checking in case the user enters a non-existent username on chess.com, an invalid gamemode, or a missing gamemode. This was achieved using web-scraping and data-manipulation of the website source code.
- The '$plot' command builds upon the Convex Hull algorithm I created earlier as it sufficed for proof of concept. The user inputs their set of points and the bot returns the scatter plot that shows all the points, it's perimeter, and value of the perimeter and area, all in one image for a quick representation for the user.
- The '$search' command sends the user the first google image of their search or at their desired index using Selenium.<br>
