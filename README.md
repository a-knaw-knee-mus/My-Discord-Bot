# My Discord Bot
This is a discord bot I made using Python 3 and Replit to host it 24/7
- Originally used simple $ commands such as $help for all my commands
- My updated bot now uses slash commands for a more seamless and cleaner user experience
- Most of my commands have migrated to slash commands except the $plot command since the user has to input a list of points, each on a new line
